# nvim
 My nvim config


## Status
- Pretty functionally complete,
- Basic functionality should work anywhere by just cloning it or downloading the files
- More indepth functionality like linting,formatting and lsp might require installing dependancies
- should not be too difficult to find out what needs installing, because of both errors and the fact that the code is pretty well structured and commented
